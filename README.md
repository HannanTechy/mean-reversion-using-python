# mean-reversion-using-python
This strategy involves buying assets that have been underperforming and selling assets that have been overperforming. The idea is that trends tend to revert to their mean, so assets that have been underperforming are more likely to bounce back in the future.
Choose a security: Select a security that is suitable for mean reversion trading. Securities that tend to mean revert include stocks, ETFs, futures, and currencies.

Choose a time frame: Determine the time frame that you want to trade on. Mean reversion can occur on various time frames, ranging from intraday to weekly or monthly.

Compute the mean and standard deviation: Compute the rolling mean and standard deviation of the security's price over the chosen time frame.

Compute the upper and lower bands: Calculate the upper and lower bands by adding or subtracting a certain number of standard deviations from the rolling mean.

Compute the z-score: Calculate the z-score as the difference between the security's price and the rolling mean divided by the rolling standard deviation.

Identify buy and sell signals: Identify buy signals when the z-score falls below a certain threshold, indicating that the price is oversold and likely to rebound. Identify sell signals when the z-score rises above another threshold, indicating that the price is overbought and likely to decline.

Place trades: Place trades based on the buy and sell signals, using appropriate risk management techniques.

Monitor and adjust: Monitor the strategy's performance and adjust the parameters as necessary. Mean reversion strategies can be sensitive to changes in volatility or market conditions, so it's important to stay vigilant and adapt as needed.
